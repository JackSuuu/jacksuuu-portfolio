### Hi there 👋 This is Jack

I am a dedicated and detail-oriented technology enthusiast with expertise in Python, Java, and front-end development (HTML/CSS & JavaScript) and UI/UX design. 
Currently expanding my skills in machine learning (PyTorch, Tensorflow) and back-end development with Django. 
I aim to providing advance thoughts and insights with meaningful implementation to manifest the beauty of the internal world of my mind.
I believe the beauty will manifest through the contemplation of the logical relationship of matters.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
